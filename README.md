Kali GISKismet Enhanced

GISkismet appears to be out-of-development for 3 years.  I have some enhancements I will be adding to the source I found in the Kali Linux Git Repositories (git://git.kali.org/packages/giskismet.git) .  I am new to "git", so excuse me as I learn as I go.  I believe this cannot be a "fork", since there is no place this is actively developed.

	* Added a simple -f/--force option to bypass interaction on output files.
